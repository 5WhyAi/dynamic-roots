        <h1>Marriage and Divorce in America</h1>
        <p>Understanding the dynamics of marriage and divorce in America provides valuable insights into family structures and the challenges many face. Below, we explore statistics surrounding first marriages, divorce rates, and the implications for children and families.</p>

        <div class="statistics">
            <h2>Key Statistics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>41%</strong> of first marriages end in divorce.</li>
                <li>The average length of a first marriage is <strong>7.9 years</strong>.</li>
                <li>On average, couples wait <strong>6 years</strong> before having children in their first marriage.</li>
                <li>There are approximately <strong>2 million marriages</strong> each year in the U.S.</li>
                <li><strong>59%</strong> of these are first marriages, equating to approximately <strong>1.18 million</strong> first marriages annually.</li>
                <li>Of these first marriages, approximately <strong>483,800</strong> will end in divorce.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Implications for Families and Children</h2>
        <p>Many couples decide to have children around the sixth year of marriage, with divorces frequently occurring around the eighth year. This creates a significant number of children who experience their parents' separation at a young age, often growing up within a co-parenting arrangement.</p>
        <p>These statistics underscore the importance of addressing the factors that contribute to marital dissolution and the need for supporting families during these transitions to ensure the well-being of children.</p>
