                            <p>We start with the average timeline for divorce and how it overlaps with major life milestones. This will clearly show how pivotal years of one’s life are often consumed by lengthy legal battles and increased stress.</p>

                                <li><strong>Average Age at First Marriage:</strong>

                                <li><strong>Average Time to Divorce:</strong> The average duration of a first marriage before divorce is approximately 7.8 years. For men who marry at 28, they are likely to initiate divorce proceedings at around 36-37 years old, and for women who marry at 26, it happens around 34-35 years old.</li>

                                <li><strong>Fastest Possible Outcome:</strong> In cases without children, property disputes, or major complications, divorces can be finalized in as little as 6 months to 1 year, depending on the state and cooperation between the parties.</li>
                                <li><strong>Average Timeline (Contested Divorces):</strong> When disputes around property, children, or finances are involved, the average divorce can take anywhere from 1 to 2 years to finalize.</li>
                                <li><strong>Longest Possible Outcome (High-Conflict Cases):</strong> In highly contested cases, divorces can drag on for 5 to 7 years or more, with involvement from specialists like parenting coordinators, guardians ad litem, and ongoing court hearings.</li>
